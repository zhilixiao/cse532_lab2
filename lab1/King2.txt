35 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
18 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
17 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, 
16 So much as from occasion you may glean, 
15 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, 
14 Some little time: so by your companies 
13 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court 
12 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour, 
11 That, being of so young days brought up with him, 
10 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both 
9  So much from the understanding of himself, 
8  More than his father's death, that thus hath put him 
7  Resembles that it was. What it should be, 
6  Since nor the exterior nor the inward man 
5  Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it, 
4  Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 
3  The need we have to use you did provoke 
2  Moreover that we much did long to see you, 
1  Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
